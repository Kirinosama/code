数据结构题 拿好拿的部分分
构造题  特判范围很小的情况/可能会有例外/大的有固定构造方法	
几何题	拿模版能拿的分/时间复杂度要求不高/用最好写的算法
dp题	想如何优化转移/换dp方式/减少状态/想..最优
图论	简化模型/看清题意
数学	简单推一下 放弃

题答	
交互

训练重点:
1.常规算法模版 保证正确性和速度
2.如何找每题的idea
3.几何题及图论训练
4.数学题和dp题训练


*need to notice:
1. high accuracy first
2. time first
3. simple first
4. don't use too much time on each problem
5. if have ideas, solve it.
6. write down a queue.(order for gets pts)
6. long codes (low accuracy) for special pts 
	push into queues and solve later

how to solve problems:
0. read 3 problems carefully and choose one
1. get ideas(not very long)
2. look for simple pts(dont take much time)
3. get more ideas{
	4. look for special pts(dont take much time either)(low difficult for writing)
	4. solve 100 pts (usually not very difficult to write)
}
5. switch another problem
6. check the accuracy

reason for can't solving the problems:

1. knowledge haven't learn
2. don't know how to think(for construct problem)
3. math problems

need to change:
1. how to get pts in graph problems?
2. how to get idea in the problem?
